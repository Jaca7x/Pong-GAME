# Basic Pong game

### As a beginner learning C and game development, creating a clone of the classic Pong game is a great way to start. Using the Raylib library, which is designed for simple and fast game programming, it's possible to build a fully working Pong game with just basic knowledge of programming.

### In this project, two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen using keyboard input. A ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom edges. If it hits a paddle, it bounces back, and the speed increases slightly to make the game more challenging. If the ball passes beyond a paddle, the opposing player scores a point and the ball resets to the center.

### Raylib makes it easy to handle graphics, input, and collision detection. You can draw rectangles for the paddles, a circle for the ball, and use functions like CheckCollisionCircleRec() or manual distance calculations for collision detection.

### This project helps beginners understand:

- 2D game loops and logic

- Keyboard input handling

- Collision detection

- Using structs like Vector2 and Rectangle

- Drawing on screen with Raylib functions
